## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project is an exercise to practice collecting and cleaning a data set. 
A data set was retrieved from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, processed and cleaned according to exercise instructions.

The products of this project includes the following files:

* README.md : this file
* run_analysis.R : R script to process and clean the downloaded raw data set
* average.txt : the product of the data cleaning process -- an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* CodeBook.md : a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations that have been performed to clean up the data
